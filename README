*The Cucumber App
This application is putting a run timer for selected app and with selected time value.
The reason I made this app is because I couldn't find a way to limit my cousine's gaming.
He is playing cracked games and you can't put a time on cracked games in legal way like using Steam family or Microsoft family etc.
Right now it is not really effective but I can make it forecfully useable.
